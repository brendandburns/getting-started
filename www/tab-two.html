In Kubernetes <i>Replication Controllers</i> provide scalability and reliability.  Their job is to replicate
each layer in your system so that if a failure occurs in one instance of your application, other instances
are running to replaced the failed instance while Kubernetes restarts the server.  Replication Controllers
also provide a "size" knob which makes scaling to provide additional capacity easy.

<div class="paragraph">
Replication Controllers use a Pod definition as the blueprint and add a desired number of replicas, as well
as a <i>replicaSelector</i> that identifies the set of Pods that are managed by the Replication Controller.
