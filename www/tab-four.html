    You have now been introduced to the three core concepts in Kubernetes:
    <dl>
      <dt class="type">Pods</dt>
      <dd>Groups of co-located containers working together</dd>
      <dt class="type">Replication Controllers</dt>
      <dd>Sets of Pods that are replicated for reliability and scale</dd>
      <dt class="type">Services</dt>
      <dd>A named endpoint providing load-balanced access to a set of pods</dd>
    </dl>

    Now you will have an opportunity to deploy the examples you have created to a working
    cluster.
